          <p style="break-inside: avoid;">On June 13, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision holding that the plaintiffs in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-235_n7ip.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link--external">FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</a>
 lacked standing to challenge FDA’s actions. Mifepristone—which FDA 
approved as safe and effective more than 20 years ago—remains available 
under the conditions of use approved by FDA.</p>

ensuring women can make their own decisions about their own bodies, and

          <p>Reproductive health care, including access to birth control
 and safe and legal abortion care, is an essential part of your health 
and well-being. While Roe&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Wade was overturned, abortion 
remains legal in many states, and other reproductive health care 
services remain protected by law. The U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) is committed to providing you with accurate and 
up-to-date information about access to and coverage of reproductive 
health care and resources. Our goal is to make sure you have appropriate
 information and support.</p>

          <p>Below you will find information on your right to access 
reproductive health care, what your health insurance is required to 
cover, and where to go if you need health insurance.</p>
          <p>Whether you get coverage through your employer, Medicaid, 
HealthCare.gov, or elsewhere in the private insurance market, most plans
 cover family planning counseling, birth control, and other preventive 
services at no additional cost to you.  Federal law allows 
federally-funded health coverage (like Medicaid) to cover abortion in 
some situations, and some private health insurance plans also cover 
abortion care.</p>

 requires Medicare-participating hospital emergency departments to offer
 any person who requests it an appropriate medical screening examination
 within the capability of the hospital’s emergency department.</li>
              <li>If the hospital determines that you have an emergency 
medical condition, federal law requires the hospital to offer you 
treatment until your emergency medical condition is stabilized, or an 
appropriate transfer to another hospital if you need it.</li>
              <li>An emergency medical condition includes any medical 
condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms and that, in the absence 
of immediate medical attention, could reasonably be expected to place 
the person’s health in serious jeopardy.  Emergency medical conditions 
involving pregnant patients may include, but are not limited to, ectopic
 pregnancy, complications of a pregnancy loss, or emergent hypertensive 
disorders, such as preeclampsia with severe features.  In some 
instances, the treatment reasonably necessary to stabilize a pregnant 
woman’s emergency medical condition may be an abortion.</li>
              <li>These federal rights preempt any directly conflicting state laws or mandates that apply to specific procedures.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></li>

            <p>If you are covered through Medicaid:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>While federal Medicaid funds can only cover abortion 
in the circumstances of rape, incest or if the patient’s life is in 
danger, there are over a dozen states that provide more comprehensive 
coverage for abortion using state Medicaid funds.  To find out more on 
state funding of abortions under Medicaid <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/abortion-under-medicaid/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" class="usa-link--external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit this website</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are covered through your employer, a plan offered 
through the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces, or elsewhere in the 
private market:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coverage will vary by state, employer, and insurance 
company. In some states, private health insurance plans (including 
employer coverage) are required or allowed to cover abortion in either 
all or certain circumstances. Review your plan benefits document to find
 out whether your plan covers abortion. If you are using a plan where 
you are not the primary policy holder (for example if you are on a 
parent’s or spouse’s plan), be mindful that the policy holder may 
receive documentation from the plan known as an “Explanation of 
Benefits” that includes information about your care.</li>
            </ul>

may be able to provide financial assistance.  Information about abortion
